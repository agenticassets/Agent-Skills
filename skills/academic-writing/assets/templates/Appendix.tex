%% INSTRUCTIONS: Replace placeholder variable names with your actual variables:
%%   - [OUTCOME_VAR_1], [OUTCOME_VAR_2], etc. → Your dependent variables
%%   - [TREATMENT_VAR], [MODERATOR_VAR], etc. → Your independent variables
%%   - [CONTROL_VAR_1], [CONTROL_VAR_2], etc. → Your control variables
%%
%% Keep the longtable structure and formatting. Structure definitions clearly with:
%%   1. Variable name (left column)
%%   2. Definition + calculation + source (right column)
%%
%% For continuous variables: Include range, calculation method, and source
%% For indicator variables: Explain threshold and coding (0/1)
%% For lagged variables: Specify lag structure

    {\textit{Notes:} All firm-level variables are measured [FREQUENCY] unless otherwise specified. Lagged versions (denoted as ``Lag 1'') use the previous period's value. Sample period is [START_YEAR]-[END_YEAR]. All continuous variables are winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles to reduce the influence of outliers. Additional variable-specific notes: [INSERT_NOTES].} \\
