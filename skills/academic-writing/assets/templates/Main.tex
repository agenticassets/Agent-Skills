%
% BEFORE YOU START WRITING: Read this guide to understand how to customize
% this template for your research project.
%
% STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR PAPER STRUCTURE
% ────────────────────────────────────
% This template provides TWO organizational structures:
%
% STRUCTURE A (Recommended for tightly integrated work):
%   - Hypotheses, Methods, and Data Sources [ACTIVE - Lines 186-306]
%   - Results, Figures, Appendix, Internet Appendix
%
% STRUCTURE B (Classical academic organization):
%   - Introduction, Literature Review, Data and Methodology, Results,
%     Discussion, Conclusion, Appendix, Internet Appendix
%   - Uncomment sections in the comment block starting at line 308
%
% If using STRUCTURE B:
%   1. Delete or comment out "Hypotheses, Methods, and Data Sources"
%   2. Uncomment the Introduction through Conclusion sections
%   3. Customize the content placeholders
%   4. Keep the Results/Figures/Appendix/Internet Appendix order at the end
%
% STEP 2: CUSTOMIZE PLACEHOLDERS
% ────────────────────────────────
% Replace all [PLACEHOLDER] variables throughout the document:
%
% Title Page:
%   [Your Research Title Here]
%   [Author 1/2/3 Name], [Institution], [email]
%
% Abstract:
%   [RESEARCH QUESTION], [TREATMENT], [MECHANISM], [OUTCOME VARIABLE],
%   [IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY], [DATA SOURCES], [KEY RESULT], [CONTRIBUTION]
%
% Methodology:
%   [TREATMENT VARIABLE], [OUTCOME VARIABLE], [CAUSAL MECHANISM],
%   [SOURCE OF EXOGENOUS VARIATION], [CLUSTERING LEVEL], etc.
%
% Keywords & JEL Classification:
%   [Keywords 1-4] and [JEL Codes]
%
% STEP 3: PREPARE YOUR RESULTS
% ────────────────────────────
% The template automatically imports results from section files:
%   - Writing/sections/Results.tex     (main empirical results)
%   - Writing/sections/Figures.tex     (figures and plots)
%   - Writing/sections/Appendix.tex    (technical appendix)
%   - Writing/sections/Internet_Results.tex (online appendix)
%
% These files use \input{../Results/Tables/[TABLE_NAME].tex} to include
% your auto-generated tables from the analysis pipeline.
%
% STEP 4: COMPILE AND TEST
% ────────────────────────
% After customizing, compile the document:
%   Windows PowerShell: .\Writing\compile_latex.ps1
%   Linux/Mac Bash:     ./Writing/compile_latex.sh
%
% The compilation script handles:
%   - Citation validation
%   - LaTeX compilation (4-step process)
%   - Auxiliary file cleanup
%
% STEP 5: VERIFY INTEGRATION
% ───────────────────────────
% Make sure all \input{} commands can find files:
%   - Results/Tables/ contains your .tex table files
%   - Results/Figures/ contains your .pdf figure files
%   - References/references.bib contains your citations
%
% If compilation fails, check:
%   1. File paths in \input{} and \includegraphics{} commands
%   2. Bibliography entry exists for all cited works
%   3. No special characters or unescaped LaTeX in titles

\section{Hypotheses, Methods, and Data Sources}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% TEMPLATE GUIDANCE FOR METHODOLOGY SECTION:
% This section introduces your research design and key variables.
% It should answer these questions:
% (1) What is your research question and hypothesis?
% (2) What identification strategy do you use? What is your source of variation?
% (3) What data do you use? How do you measure key variables?
% (4) What is your econometric specification?
%
% STRUCTURE: Research question → Hypothesis → Data → Identification strategy → Econometric model
%
% ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURE: If you prefer traditional sections (Introduction, Literature Review, Data, Methodology),
% see the commented-out sections below this subsection for an alternative template.
% You can uncomment those sections and customize them instead.

\subsection{Research Question and Hypothesis}
% TEMPLATE GUIDANCE:
% 1. State your research question clearly and concisely
% 2. Provide theoretical or empirical motivation
% 3. Explain the proposed causal mechanism
% 4. Preview why this matters (contribution)

This paper investigates whether [RESEARCH QUESTION/PHENOMENON].
We hypothesize that [TREATMENT/INTERVENTION] facilitates [CAUSAL MECHANISM], which affects [OUTCOME VARIABLE].
Specifically, we posit the following channel: [TREATMENT] → [MECHANISM] → [INTERMEDIATE OUTCOME] → [FINAL OUTCOME].
This research question matters because [MOTIVATION/IMPORTANCE FOR THEORY/PRACTICE].

\subsection{Data Sources and Sample Construction}
% TEMPLATE GUIDANCE:
% 1. Identify all data sources and their coverage
% 2. Describe sample selection criteria clearly
% 3. Note any sample restrictions and their justification
% 4. Reference Table 1 (summary statistics) if available

Our analysis uses [KEY DATA SOURCES], including [DATA 1], [DATA 2], and [DATA 3].
[DATA 1] provides [coverage/variables], covering [time period] with [sample size] observations.
We restrict our analysis to [SAMPLE RESTRICTION 1] and [SAMPLE RESTRICTION 2], which yields a final sample of [N OBSERVATIONS, SAMPLE PERIOD].
Summary statistics are presented in Table~\ref{tab:summary_statistics}.

\subsection{Variable Definitions and Measurement}
% TEMPLATE GUIDANCE:
% 1. Define dependent variables clearly
% 2. Define independent/treatment variables
% 3. Explain construction of key variables
% 4. Justify measurement choices by reference to literature

\subsubsection{Dependent Variable: [OUTCOME VARIABLE NAME]}
Our primary dependent variable is [OUTCOME VARIABLE], measured as [MEASUREMENT APPROACH].
Following [KEY REFERENCE PAPERS], we compute [SPECIFIC CALCULATION/FORMULA].
This measure captures [INTERPRETATION/ECONOMIC MEANING].

\subsubsection{Treatment/Independent Variable: [TREATMENT VARIABLE NAME]}
The main independent variable is [TREATMENT VARIABLE], measured as [MEASUREMENT APPROACH].
We employ [TREATMENT VARIATION SOURCE] to identify the causal effect of [TREATMENT].
Specifically, [DESCRIPTION OF VARIATION/SOURCE OF EXOGENOUS VARIATION].

\subsubsection{Control Variables}
The vector $X_{t-1}$ includes lagged control variables: [CONTROL 1] ([DEFINITION/JUSTIFICATION]), [CONTROL 2] ([DEFINITION/JUSTIFICATION]), [CONTROL 3], and [CONTROL 4].
We lag control variables by one period to mitigate simultaneity concerns.

\subsection{Identification Strategy}
% TEMPLATE GUIDANCE:
% 1. Clearly state your identification assumption
% 2. Explain the source of exogenous variation
% 3. Discuss potential confounds and how you address them
% 4. Describe any first-stage or validity tests

The primary challenge to identifying the causal effect of [TREATMENT] on [OUTCOME] is [ENDOGENEITY CONCERN].
We address this through [IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY], exploiting [SOURCE OF EXOGENOUS VARIATION].
Intuitively, [EXPLANATION OF WHY VARIATION IS EXOGENOUS].

[VALIDITY TESTS OR FIRST STAGE EVIDENCE]: We validate this approach by documenting [SUPPORTING EVIDENCE].
This establishes that [TREATMENT] varies significantly across our sample due to [SOURCE OF VARIATION].

\subsection{Econometric Specification}
% TEMPLATE GUIDANCE:
% 1. Present main specification clearly with equation
% 2. Define all variables, subscripts, and notation
% 3. Explain fixed effects and their purpose
% 4. Justify standard error clustering choices
% 5. Note any alternative specifications

Our baseline specification is:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:main_spec}
[OUTCOME]_{i,t} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}[TREATMENT]_{i,t} + X'_{i,t-1}\gamma + \delta_{[UNIT]} + \tau_{[TIME]} + \epsilon_{i,t}
\end{equation}

where $[OUTCOME]_{i,t}$ is the dependent variable for unit [UNIT TYPE] $i$ in period $t$;
$[TREATMENT]_{i,t}$ is the treatment variable;
$X'_{i,t-1}$ is a vector of lagged control variables;
$\delta_{[UNIT]}$ represents [UNIT]-level fixed effects (absorbing [UNIT-LEVEL VARIATION]);
$\tau_{[TIME]}$ represents time fixed effects (absorbing [TIME-LEVEL VARIATION]);
and $\epsilon_{i,t}$ is the error term.

The coefficient of interest is $\beta_{1}$, which captures [INTERPRETATION OF COEFFICIENT].
Standard errors are clustered at the [CLUSTERING LEVEL] to account for [CORRELATION STRUCTURE].

\subsection{Theoretical Framework}
% TEMPLATE GUIDANCE:
% 1. Connect empirical work to theory
% 2. Explain predicted effects under alternative scenarios
% 3. Discuss competing mechanisms or hypotheses
% 4. Provide intuition for expected results and interpretation

Our theoretical framework predicts [NUMBER] possible scenarios:

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textit{Hypothesis 1 - [PRIMARY MECHANISM]:} If [TREATMENT] increases through the mechanism of [MECHANISM 1], then we expect [OUTCOME] to [DIRECTION] by approximately [PREDICTED MAGNITUDE].
This would support the theory that [THEORETICAL INTERPRETATION].

\item \textit{Hypothesis 2 - [ALTERNATIVE MECHANISM]:} If instead [MECHANISM 2] dominates, we would expect [ALTERNATIVE OUTCOME DIRECTION].
This scenario would suggest [ALTERNATIVE THEORETICAL INTERPRETATION].

\end{enumerate}

By examining [MECHANISM TESTS/HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS], we can distinguish between these scenarios and provide evidence on which mechanism is operative.
