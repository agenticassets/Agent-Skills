# Introduction Patterns

Academic introduction structure for finance, economics, and real estate research.

## Standard 4-Paragraph Structure

### Paragraph 1: Motivation (Why This Question Matters)

**Purpose**: Establish importance and real-world relevance

**Pattern**:
```
[Broad phenomenon] is important because [economic/social impact].
[Specific context] involves [dollar amounts/scale/stakeholders].
Understanding [research question] matters for [policy/theory/practice].
```

**Example (Real Estate)**:
```
Commercial real estate represents over $20 trillion in U.S. assets and serves as collateral for substantial debt markets.
Institutional investors increasingly rely on alternative data sources to evaluate property-level fundamentals.
Understanding how machine learning models affect pricing efficiency matters for market participants and regulators.
```

### Paragraph 2: Gap (What We Don't Know)

**Purpose**: Identify the puzzle or tension in existing knowledge

**Pattern**:
```
Despite [established fact], we observe [surprising pattern/contradiction].
Prior research shows [X], but [Y remains unexplained].
This creates a puzzle: [clear statement of gap].
Answering this question is difficult because [empirical challenge].
```

**Example**:
```
Despite advances in predictive analytics, we lack evidence on how AI-driven property valuations affect market outcomes.
Prior research documents algorithmic trading in equities but not in illiquid real estate markets.
This creates a puzzle: do algorithmic valuations improve pricing efficiency or amplify information asymmetries?
Answering this question is difficult because identifying exogenous variation in AI adoption is challenging.
```

### Paragraph 3: This Paper (Contribution)

**Purpose**: State what you do, find, and contribute

**Pattern**:
```
This paper [action verb: examines/investigates/tests] [specific question].
We use [data source] covering [sample description].
Our identification strategy exploits [quasi-experiment/natural variation/instrument].
We find that [main result with magnitude].
This finding contributes to [literature stream] by [specific advance].
```

**Example**:
```
This paper examines whether AI-based property valuations affect transaction prices in commercial real estate.
We use proprietary data from a major valuation platform covering 45,000 office buildings from 2015-2023.
Our identification strategy exploits staggered AI model deployment across metropolitan areas.
We find that AI adoption increases price efficiency by 12% but widens bid-ask spreads by 8 basis points.
This finding contributes to the literature on information technology and asset pricing by documenting both benefits and frictions from algorithmic intermediation.
```

### Paragraph 4: Roadmap (Paper Structure)

**Purpose**: Preview paper organization

**Pattern**:
```
The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows.
Section 2 reviews related literature and develops testable hypotheses.
Section 3 describes our data and empirical methodology.
Section 4 presents [main results].
Section 5 explores [mechanisms/robustness/heterogeneity].
Section 6 concludes.
```

## Common Introduction Mistakes

### ❌ Avoid These Patterns

**Vague motivation**: "Real estate is important" → Too broad, no specific stakes

**Literature-first opening**: "Smith (2020) finds..." → Start with phenomenon, not papers

**Burying the contribution**: Waiting until page 3 to state what you find → Front-load findings

**Hypothesis spoilers**: "We predict X will increase Y" in intro → Save predictions for Section 2

**Overselling**: "First paper to ever..." → Usually false, reviewers will cite counterexamples

### ✅ Use These Patterns Instead

**Specific stakes**: "Pension funds allocate $X billion to CRE, making valuation accuracy critical"

**Phenomenon-first**: "[Surprising fact/pattern] motivates our investigation of..."

**Early results**: State main finding in Paragraph 3, don't make readers hunt for it

**Hypothesis placement**: Intro states question; Section 2 develops formal predictions

**Modest framing**: "We contribute to X literature by providing first evidence on Y context"

## Discipline-Specific Conventions

### Finance
- Emphasize asset pricing implications
- Reference anomaly literature if applicable
- Quantify economic magnitudes (basis points, Sharpe ratios, alpha)

### Economics
- Connect to welfare or policy
- Emphasize causal identification
- Discuss external validity

### Real Estate
- Bridge finance and urban economics literatures
- Discuss spatial/location dimensions
- Connect micro findings to macro implications

## Useful Framing Verbs

**What You Do**:
- Examine, investigate, analyze, test, estimate, document, explore

**What You Find**:
- We find, we show, we document, our results indicate, our estimates suggest

**What You Contribute**:
- We contribute, we advance, we extend, we provide first evidence, we reconcile

## Length Guidelines

- **Total intro**: 3-5 pages (double-spaced)
- **Paragraph 1**: 0.5-1 page
- **Paragraph 2**: 0.5-1 page
- **Paragraph 3**: 1-2 pages (most important)
- **Paragraph 4**: 0.25 pages (brief roadmap)

## Citation Patterns

**First mention**: Full context citation
```
Recent work by \citet{author2023} documents algorithmic pricing in residential markets.
```

**Subsequent mentions**: Brief parenthetical
```
These findings align with \citep{author2023}.
```

**Multiple citations**: Chronological or thematic order
```
Prior studies \citep{author2020, author2021, author2023} examine...
```
