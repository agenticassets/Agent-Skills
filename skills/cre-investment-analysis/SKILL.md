# Commercial Real Estate Investment Analysis & Business Plan

Professional-grade commercial real estate investment analysis combining academic rigor with institutional underwriting standards. This skill produces defensible, audit-ready analyses suitable for lenders, equity partners, institutional investors, and academic research.

## Core Capabilities

### Investment Analysis
- **Property Types**: Multifamily, office, retail, industrial, mixed-use, land development
- **Financial Modeling**: DCF, IRR, NPV, cash-on-cash returns, equity multiples, yield metrics
- **Underwriting**: Institutional-grade assumptions, sensitivity analysis, scenario modeling
- **Market Analysis**: Supply/demand dynamics, comparable sales/leases, submarket positioning
- **Risk Assessment**: Systematic risk factors, mitigation strategies, probability-weighted outcomes

### Business Plan Development
- **Executive Summary**: Investment thesis, value proposition, target returns
- **Market Overview**: Demographics, economic drivers, competitive landscape, barriers to entry
- **Property/Portfolio Description**: Physical characteristics, tenant mix, lease analysis, capital needs
- **Financial Projections**: 5-10 year pro formas, capital structure, waterfall distributions
- **Operations Strategy**: Property management, value-add initiatives, repositioning plans
- **Exit Strategy**: Hold period rationale, exit assumptions, multiple disposition scenarios

### Analytical Frameworks
- **Acquisition Analysis**: Purchase price justification, sources & uses, closing adjustments
- **Development Feasibility**: Land basis, hard/soft costs, construction timeline, lease-up assumptions
- **Disposition Strategy**: Hold vs. sell analysis, 1031 exchange considerations, tax implications
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Correlation analysis, geographic diversification, risk-adjusted returns
- **REIT Analysis**: FFO/AFFO metrics, same-store NOI growth, leverage ratios, dividend coverage

## Methodology

### 1. Property & Market Assessment

**Physical Analysis**
- Site characteristics (location, access, visibility, topography)
- Building specifications (square footage, age, condition, systems)
- Unit mix and layouts (for multifamily)
- Parking ratios and amenities
- Deferred maintenance assessment
- Required capital expenditures

**Market Positioning**
- Submarket definition and boundaries
- Competitive set identification
- Market rent analysis (asking vs. effective)
- Occupancy trends and absorption rates
- New supply pipeline
- Economic and demographic drivers
- Transportation and infrastructure

### 2. Financial Underwriting

**Revenue Modeling**
- In-place vs. market rents (roll-to-market analysis)
- Lease expiration schedule
- Renewal probability and rent escalations
- Vacancy and collection loss assumptions (market-based)
- Ancillary income (parking, laundry, pet fees, etc.)
- Percentage rent (for retail)

**Operating Expense Projection**
- Property taxes (actual + projected reassessment)
- Insurance (property, liability, flood if applicable)
- Utilities (tenant vs. landlord responsibility)
- Repairs and maintenance (% of EGI or per-unit/SF)
- Property management (% of EGI, typically 3-5%)
- Administrative costs
- Payroll (on-site staff if applicable)
- Contract services (landscaping, security, etc.)
- Replacement reserves ($/unit or $/SF annually)

**Capital Structure**
- Debt: LTV ratio, interest rate, amortization, IO period, prepayment penalties
- Equity: Preferred vs. common, promote structure, waterfall tiers
- Total project costs: Acquisition, closing, renovation, lease-up reserves
- Sources and uses statement

**Cash Flow Analysis**
- Levered vs. unlevered returns
- Before-tax vs. after-tax analysis
- Free cash flow to equity
- Promote/carry calculations
- Sensitivity to key variables (rent, occupancy, exit cap)

### 3. Valuation Methods

**Income Approach**
- Direct capitalization: NOI / cap rate
- Discounted Cash Flow (DCF): NPV of cash flows + reversion
- Terminal value calculation (exit cap rate or cap rate compression/expansion)

**Sales Comparison Approach**
- Price per unit (multifamily)
- Price per square foot (office, retail, industrial)
- Adjustments for condition, location, size, vintage
- Recent comparable transactions analysis

**Cost Approach** (primarily for new construction)
- Land value + replacement cost - depreciation
- Developer's profit and entrepreneurial incentive

### 4. Risk & Sensitivity Analysis

**Scenario Modeling**
- Base case (most likely)
- Downside case (conservative assumptions)
- Upside case (optimistic but achievable)

**Sensitivity Tables**
- Two-way tables (e.g., exit cap vs. rental growth)
- Monte Carlo simulation for complex portfolios
- Stress testing (recession scenario, interest rate shock)

**Key Risk Factors**
- Market risk (supply/demand imbalance)
- Lease-up risk (new construction or major repositioning)
- Interest rate risk (floating rate debt, refinance risk)
- Operational risk (management, deferred maintenance)
- Liquidity risk (ability to exit on timeline)
- Regulatory/political risk (rent control, zoning changes)
