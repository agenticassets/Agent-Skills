2. **Understand methodologies**: Different providers may define markets differently
3. **Check vintage**: Ensure data is current (check publication/update date)
4. **Validate with local sources**: Ground-truth against local brokers and property managers
5. **Document assumptions**: Note data sources in all models and reports

### Common Discrepancies
- **Market boundaries**: Submarkets defined differently by providers
- **Property classifications**: Class A/B/C definitions vary
- **Rental rates**: Asking vs. effective rents
- **Occupancy**: Physical vs. economic occupancy
- **Timing**: Quarterly vs. monthly updates, lag times

### Data Source Priority (by use case)

2. **Rent comps**: CoStar > Yardi Matrix > local surveys
3. **Market trends**: REIS > CBRE/JLL > local data
4. **Forecasting**: REIS > CBRE/JLL/Cushman > PwC survey
5. **REIT analysis**: Green Street > SNL > NAREIT
6. **Demographics**: Census > BLS > local economic development
